Now that you know a little about the various categories of NLP applications, do you think you can identify 
these when considering particular applications? Give it a try.
● In a file called nlp_1.pdf, categorise each of the following use-cases:
(Use the categories we have discussed on this bootcamp so far)

a. A model that allocates which mail folder an email should be sent to (work, friends, promotions, 
important), like Gmail’s inbox tabs.

Text Processing model will be used to allocate mails to relevant folders based on their content. This would 
involve training a model to assign predefined categories or labels(work, friends, promotions, important) to 
text documents based on their content. So the content of the email will be analyzed to categorize them into 
specific folders.

b. A model that helps decide what grade to award to an essay question. This can be used by a university 
professor who grades a lot of classes or essay competitions.

Automatic Summarization model will be used where the essays can be condensed with the main ideas to aid the 
professor to skim through a large number of essays and efficiently grade a large number of essays.

c. A model that provides assistive technology for doctors to provide their diagnosis. Remember, doctors ask 
questions, so the model will use the patients’ answers to provide probable diagnoses for the doctor to weigh 
and make decisions on.

Question Answering model will be used where doctors can pose their questions and the model will use the 
patients’ answers to provide probable diagnoses. It will support doctors in making informed decisions 
about diagnoses.
